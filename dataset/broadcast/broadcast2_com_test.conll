out O
what O

But DEL
researchers O

It O

New DEL
studies O

the O

factors O
which O

also O

Research O
presented DEL
by O
the O
Families O

develop O
earlier O
than O

thought O

Experts DEL
say DEL
this O
new O
body DEL
of DEL
knowledge O
has O
overwhelming O
cultural O
ramifications O
. O

Kids O
attending O
this O
day O

are O
receiving O
the O
attention O
they O
need O
. O

But DEL
those O
who O

may O
always DEL
been O

, O
socially O
and O
emotionally O
. O

I O

I O
do O

care O
if O
you O

all DEL
your O

You O

the O

The O
evidence O
is O
in. O

Scientists O
have O
looked O
at O
this O
issue O
about O
the O
first O
years O
of O
life O
. O

They O
've O
looked O
in O
the O
uterus O
and O
they O
know O
that O
this O
is O
the O
basic DEL
building O
block O
of DEL
time DEL
that O
will O
determine O
the O
success O
or O
failure O
of DEL
children DEL
later O
in O

. O

Scientists O
say O
we O
're O
seeing O
more O
and DEL
more DEL
tragic O
examples O
of O
these O
kinds O
of O
failures O
. O

Surges O
in O
kid DEL

, O
where O
children O
feel O
little O
or O
no O
remorse O
about O
what O
they O

done O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
have O
remorse O
. O

They O
have DEL
regret O
that O
they O
got O

Regret O
is O
an O
intellectual O

Remorse O
is O
an O
affective O
response DEL
, O
an DEL
emotional O
response O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
. O

And DEL
the O
irony O
, O
social DEL
scientists DEL
say DEL
, DEL
is O
that O
those O
most O
important O

years O
are O
often DEL
the O

It O

more O

, DEL
the O
Russian O
presidential O

- O
a O

all DEL

certain O
now DEL
between O
President O
Boris O
Yeltsin O
and O
Communist O

. O

Whatever DEL
the O

high O
for O

Ralph O

who O
joins O

from O

with O
the O

. O

Ralph O
? O

It DEL
is DEL
early DEL
morning DEL
on DEL
Red DEL
Square DEL
in DEL
Moscow DEL
, DEL
and DEL
all DEL
is DEL
quiet DEL
here DEL
in DEL
Moscow DEL
as DEL
the DEL
Boris O
Yeltsin O
is O
edging O
out O
Communist DEL
Party DEL
challenger DEL
Gennady O
Zyuganov O
in O
the O
first O
round O
of O
the O
Russian DEL
election O
, O
but O
not O
by O
enough O
to O
avoid O
a O
runoff O
, DEL
as DEL
you DEL
said DEL
, DEL
Jill DEL
. O

With O
about DEL
50 O
percent O
, O
that DEL
is DEL
al- DEL
more O
than O
half O
of O
the O
votes O
counted O
now O
, O
Mr. DEL
Yeltsin O
leads O
Mr. DEL
Zyuganov O
by O
about DEL
3 O
points O
. O

The O
third-place O
candidate O
is O
retired O
Army O
General O
Alexander O
Lebed O
, O
who O
has O
enough O
votes O
to O
make O
him O
a O
desirable O
target O
for O
political O
bargaining O
, O
which O
already O
beginning O
here DEL
in O
Moscow O
. O

On O
Russian O
television O
, O
which O
has O
almost DEL
ignored O
everyone O
but O
Mr. O
Yeltsin O
in O
the O
past O
few DEL
weeks O
, O
Lebed O
suddenly DEL
appeared O
for O
an O
interview O
. O

General DEL
Lebed O
implied O
that O
he O
would O
begin O
military O
reforms O
tomorrow O
if O
Mr. DEL
Yeltsin O
appoints O
him O
to O
a O
government O
post O
. O

I O
have O
program O
for O
the O
army DEL
reform O
, O
and O
I O
just DEL
need O
power O
. O

If O
I O
get O
authority O
I O
will O
look O
up O
to O
the O
expectations O
that DEL
people DEL
have DEL
. O

Mr. DEL
Lebed O
conceded O
, DEL
however DEL
, DEL
that O
his O
time O
has O
not O
yet O
come O
to O
be O
president O
of DEL
Russia DEL
. O

For DEL
months DEL
, DEL
skeptics O
about DEL
the DEL
Russian DEL
election DEL
here DEL
in DEL
Moscow DEL
have O
speculated O
that O
Boris DEL
Yeltsin O
might O
approve O
fraud O
to O
guarantee O
a O
victory O
. O

More O
than O
1,000 O
international O
observers O
have O
been O
watching O
the O
election O
. O

One O
of O
them O
, DEL
in DEL
an DEL
interesting DEL
twist DEL
, DEL
is O
former O
U.S. O
Central O
Intelligence O
Agency O
director O
James O
Woolsey O
, O
who O
once O
inspected O
Russia O
through O
spy O
satellites O
. O

A DEL
few DEL
hours DEL
earlier DEL
when DEL
it DEL
was DEL
still DEL
dark DEL
, DEL
I O
asked O
Woolsey O
about O
his O
observations O
at O
the O
polling O
places O
he O
visited O
. O

The O
small DEL
town O
of O
Klim O
[ DEL
sp DEL
] DEL
, O
just DEL
outside DEL
of DEL
Moscow DEL
where O
our O
group O
from O
the O
Jamestown O
Foundation O
was O
today O
, O
things O
appeared O
to O
be O
going O
quite DEL
well O
. O

It O
was O
really DEL
sort DEL
of DEL
stirring O
and O
touching O
in DEL
a DEL
way DEL
. O

The O
balloting O
was O
taking O
place O
quite DEL
near O
where O
the O
Russians O
had O
stopped O
the O
Nazis O
in O
their O
invasion O
of O
World O
War O
II O
. O

And DEL
I DEL
sort DEL
of DEL
thought DEL
that DEL
maybe O
both DEL
Hitler O
and O
Stalin O
were O
turning O
over O
in O
their O
graves O
to O
see O
a O
free O
election O
in O
Russia O
with O
precinct O
captains O
and O
people O
coming O
in O
happily DEL
to O
the O
polls O
, O
flowers O
in O
front O
of O
the O
constitution O
in O
celebration O
. O

It O
was O
really DEL
quite DEL
nice O
. O

From DEL
your DEL
observation DEL
of DEL
the DEL
way DEL
the DEL
procedures DEL
were DEL
done DEL
was O
there O
an O
opportunity O
for O
any DEL
kind DEL
of DEL
cheating O
in O
the O
way O
the O
votes O
were O
being O
sealed O
and DEL
so DEL
on DEL
? O

The O
procedure O
seemed O
, DEL
at DEL
the DEL
precincts DEL
we DEL
visited DEL
, DEL
three DEL
of DEL
them DEL
, DEL
simple O
and O
effective O
. O

One O
ca O
n't O
tell O
, DEL
of DEL
course DEL
, DEL
about O
the O
voting O
lists O
, O
the DEL
original DEL
lists DEL
, DEL
and O
there DEL
's DEL
no DEL
way DEL
for DEL
outside DEL
observers DEL
to DEL
tell DEL
about O
what O
might O
happen O
in O
some O
central O
location O
. O

But DEL
the O
fact O
that O
this O
is O
all DEL
paper O
ballots O
and O
paper O
counting O
would O
suggest O
that O
if O
something O
were O
done O
to O
adjust O
the O
results O
later DEL
, O
it O
would O
probably DEL
be O
fairly DEL
straight O
forward O
to O
check O
up O
on O
it. O

One DEL
of DEL
the DEL
things DEL
I DEL
noticed DEL
at DEL
the DEL
half DEL
dozen DEL
or DEL
so DEL
precincts DEL
I DEL
visited DEL
was DEL
that DEL
people O
seemed O
to O
be O
taking O
this O
very DEL
seriously O
- DEL
the DEL
voters DEL
, DEL
that DEL
is. DEL

They O
were O
coming O
to O
the O
polls O
very DEL
dressed O
up. O

They O
seemed O
to O
be O
very DEL
serious O
about O
filling O
out O
their O
ballots O
. O

Tell O
us O
what O
you O
observed O
. O

Exactly O
. O

They O
were O
happy O
. O

There O
were O
strong DEL
differences O
. O

We O
did O
some O
informal O
, DEL
not DEL
CNN DEL
style DEL
, DEL
but DEL
informal DEL
exit O
polling O
ourselves DEL
and O
found O
a O
large O
number O
of O
votes O
for O
Yeltsin O
and O
a O
smattering O
for O
other O
candidates O
. O

But DEL
people O
were- DEL
felt O
as O
if O
they O
could O
speak O
up O
and O
say O
what O
they O
thought O
. O

And DEL
say O
what O
they O
thought O
they O
did O
. O

As DEL
the DEL
results DEL
stand DEL
now DEL
, DEL
with O
about DEL
58 O
percent O
of O
the O
paper O
ballot O
counted O
, O
Boris O
Yeltsin O
leads O
Gennady O
Zyuganov O
by O
35 O
percent O
to O
32 O
percent O
, O
and O
Russia O
is O
poised O
for O
a O
runoff O
election O
between O
Mr. O
Yeltsin O
and O
Mr. O
Zyuganov O
, O
probably DEL
in O
about DEL
two O
or O
three O
weeks O
. O

Jill O
, O
Martin O
? O

OK O
, O
thank O
you O
very DEL
much DEL
, O
Ralph O
. O

President DEL
Boris O
Yeltsin O
has O
won O
the O
most O
votes O
in O
Russia O
's O
hotly DEL
contested DEL
presidential O
election O
, O
one DEL
watched O
around O
the O
world O
. O

But DEL
because O
failed O
to O
win O
a O
majority O
, O
Mr. DEL
Yeltsin O
will O
face O
Communist O
candidate O
Gennady O
Zyuganov O
in O
a O
runoff O
next O
month O
. O

Mr. DEL
Yeltsin O
captured O
35 O
percent O
of O
the O
vote O
and O
Zyuganov O
nearly O
32 O
percent DEL
. O

Former O
Soviet O
Army O
General O
Alexander O
Lebed O
finished O
third O
with O
close DEL
to DEL
15 O
percent O
of DEL
the DEL
vote DEL
. O

Democracy O
, DEL
of DEL
course DEL
, DEL
is O
new O
to O
Russia O
, O
but O
Russian O
voters O
appear O
to O
have O
sized O
up O
the O
candidates O
pretty DEL
much DEL
as O
voters O
in O
the O
West O
do O
, O
and O
the O
biggest O
issues O
were O
the O
economy O
and O
character O
. O

CNN O

Claire O

reports O
from O
Moscow O

The O
Special O
Edition O
churns O
out O
what O
most O
Russians O
had O
already DEL
expected O
- O
round O
two O
, O
Yeltsin O
and O
Zyuganov O
. O

He DEL
may DEL
be DEL
running DEL
the DEL
presses DEL
for DEL
a DEL
liberal DEL
paper DEL
, DEL
but DEL
to O
Viktor O
Skyorastan O
[ DEL
sp DEL
] DEL
, O
the DEL
news DEL
of DEL
Yeltsin O
's O
lead O
was O
disappointing O
. O

He O
is O
a O
Zyuganov O
man O
. O

Yeltsin O
promises O
a O
lot O
, O
but O
almost DEL
never O
comes O
through O
. O

Viktor DEL
says DEL
his O
wages O
have O
dropped O
substantially DEL
in O
the O
last O
five O
years O
. O

He O
ca O
n't O
even DEL
afford O
to O
take O
his O
family O
on O
a O
holiday O
. O

Exit DEL
polls O
show O
that O
Russians O
cast O
their O
ballots O
overwhelmingly DEL
based O
on O
their O
pocketbooks O
. O

Chechnya O
, O
even O

, O
paled O
by O
comparison O
. O

Oxsuna O
[ DEL

] DEL
and O
Amaryna O
[ DEL

gambled O
on O
Yeltsin O
and O
say DEL
they DEL
will O
again O
. O

My O
life O
is O
simply DEL
better O
. O

It O
's O
not O
that O
I O
like O
him O
so DEL
much DEL
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
will O
get O
worse O
with O
him O
. O

Lets O
just DEL
leave O
things O
the O
same O
. O

The O
surge DEL
of DEL
support O
for O
General O
Alexander O
Lebed O
, DEL
though DEL
, DEL
seemed O
to O
reflect O
an O
equally DEL
deep DEL
desire O
for O
order O
. O

We O
've O
had O
the O
dictators O
and O
now O
the O
bandits O
. O

We O
just DEL
need O
a O
normal O
, O
trustworthy O
person O
. O

This DEL
life O
is O
hard O
enough O
without O
all DEL
the O
instability O
and O
worry O
about O
tomorrow O
. O

Like DEL
they DEL
do DEL
with DEL
most DEL
everything DEL
else DEL
, DEL
Russians O
took O
the O
election O
results O
in O
stride O
, O
hardly O
surprised O
and O
not O
necessarily DEL
looking O
forward O
to O
another O
politically O
charged O
few O
weeks O
. O

Thirty O
percent O
of O
the O
population O
did O

What O
would O

for O
? O

I O

an DEL
engineer DEL
, DEL
now DEL
a O
pensioner O
. O

I O

But DEL
more O
than O
a O
million O
Russians O
- O
1,142,000 O
, DEL
to DEL

exact DEL
- O
were DEL
so DEL

up DEL
that DEL
they DEL
did O

Mr. O

Claire O

all DEL

. O

The O
content O
of O
those O

was O
largely DEL
kept O
secret O
, O
but O
a O
Colorado O
legislator O
gave O
CNN O

Jim DEL
Hill DEL
an O
inside O
glimpse O
. O

Weeks O
before O
the O
16 O
Freemen O
walked O
off O
their O
Montana DEL
ranch O
and O
into O
custody O
, O
their O
anger O

Colorado O
State O
Senator O
Charles O
Duke O
recorded O
his O
mediation O
efforts O
. O

In O
a O
room O
with O
12 O
armed O
Freemen O
, O
he O
said DEL
he DEL
listened O
as O
they O
called O
government O
officials O
citizen O
prostitutes O
who O
had O
no O
jurisdiction O
over O
them O

I O
did O

stand O
up O

a O

Russ O
Landers O
is O
really DEL
getting O
agitated O
and O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
but O
what DEL
at O
some O
minute O
he O
's O
going O
to O
say O
, O
`` O
And DEL
you O
're O
one O
of O
them O

' O
and O
whip O
out O
his O
gun O

me- O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
would O
do O
that O
, O
but O
, DEL
certainly DEL
, DEL
the O
possibility O
is O
there O
. O

On O
May O
21 O
, O
the O
negotiations O
broke O
off. O

When O
Duke O
failed O
in DEL
his DEL
efforts DEL
to O
mediate O
a O
settlement O
, O
he O
placed O
the O
blame O
squarely DEL
on O
the O
Freemen O
, O
saying O
many O
of O
them O
were O
not O
political DEL
idealists O
, O
but O
simply DEL
criminals O
trying O
to O
avoid O
prosecution O
. O

With O
the O
talks O
over O

the O
Freemen O

Freeman O

became O
a O

force O
inside O
the O

Duke O
said DEL
he DEL
and O
the O
FBI O
had O
tried O
to O
convince O
Clark O
to O
be O
a O
leader O
and O
counter O
the O
fiery DEL
actions O
of O
other O
Freemen O
, O
but O
Clark O
, DEL
apparently DEL
, DEL
agonized O
. O

He O
did O

want O
violence O
, O
but O
did O

I O

got O
very DEL
little O
faith O
left O
in O
me O

and O
when O
I O
finally DEL
give O
up O
is O
when O
things O
goes O
to O
hell O
in O
a O
handbasket O
. O

It O
created O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
stress O
on O
him O
. O

He O
was O
n't O
comfortable O
with O
that O
role O
initially DEL
, O
and O
, DEL
in DEL
fact DEL
, DEL
it O
took O
a O
couple O
of O

for O
him O

himself O
. O

Duke DEL
believes DEL
the O

when O

two O

It DEL
's DEL
clear DEL
that DEL
the DEL
political O
contests O
are O
heating O
up O
here DEL
as O
the O
election O
approaches O
; O
and O
added O
to O
the O
political DEL
mix O
of O
just DEL
normal O
election O
year O
politics O
are O
some DEL
other DEL
interesting DEL
factors O
, DEL
including O
Whitewater O
, O
a O
budding DEL
scandal O
over O
the O
use O
of O
the O
FBI O
potentially DEL
by O
the O
White O
House O
to O
uncover O
information O
about O
Republican O
rivals O
, O
and O
a O
whole DEL
lot O
more O
. O

The O
result O
is O
a O
stronger O
showing O
in O
the O
polls O
for O
Bob O
Dole O
. O

Joining O
me O
now DEL
to O
put O
some O
perspective O
on O
just DEL
what O
is O
going O
on O
in O
Washington O
, O
Steve O
Bell O
, O
who DEL
is DEL
the O
head O
of O
the O
Steve O
Bell O
Group O
. O

He O
joins O
us O
every O
Monday O
morning DEL
. O

Steve O
, O
good O
to O
have O
you O
with O
us. O

Glad O
to O
be O
here O
. O

Now DEL
, DEL
the O
latest O
polls O
that DEL
I DEL
'm DEL
seeing DEL
and O
hearing DEL
about DEL
indicate O
that O
Mr. DEL
Clinton O
's O
lead O
over O
Bob DEL
Dole O
has O
narrowed O
to O
single O
digits O
. O

What O
's O
going O
on O
? O

Well DEL
, DEL
I DEL
think DEL
we O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
about O
polls O
this O
far O
out DEL
from O
the O
election O
, O
but O
there DEL
's DEL
no DEL
doubt DEL
that DEL
about DEL
three O
or O
four O
weeks O
ago O
, DEL
as DEL
we DEL
discussed DEL
before DEL
, DEL
the O
president O
's O
momentum O
slowed O
drastically O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
just O
the O
Whitewater O
investigation O
and O
the O
convictions O
that O
Starr DEL
got DEL
down DEL
in-- DEL
Special O
Prosecutor O
Ken O
Starr O
got O
down DEL
in O
Arkansas O
. O

It O
was O
also O
the DEL
mistake DEL
of DEL
claiming O
the O
Soldiers O
and O
Sailors O
Act O
and O
active O
duty O
and O
all DEL
sorts DEL
of O
things O
like O
that O
. O

The DEL
fact DEL
is DEL
, DEL
of DEL
course DEL
, DEL
Dole O
got O
a O
little DEL
boost O
by O
leaving O
the O
Senate O
; O
and O
now DEL
we DEL
have DEL
a DEL
situation DEL
where DEL
the O
FBI O
files O
that DEL
have DEL
been DEL
used O
by O
the O
White O
House O
and O
sent O
back O
to DEL
the DEL
FBI DEL
have O
drawn O
criticism O
from O
Lou O
Freeh O
, O
the O
head O
of O
the O
FBI O
itself DEL
. O

And DEL
this O
is O
another O
factor O
on DEL
top DEL
of O
what O
will O
be O
an O
interesting O
Whitewater DEL
report O
when O
it DEL
's DEL
released O
officially DEL
tomorrow O
by O
the O
Whitewater O
committee O
of O
Congress O
. O

Our DEL
understanding DEL
is DEL
that DEL
the O
Whitewater O
report O
indicates O
criminal O
charges O
should O
be O
considered O
for O
some O
senior O
administration O
officials O
. O

Have O
you O
heard O
anything O
to O
that O
effect O
? O

Oh DEL
, DEL
yes O
. O

The O
rumors O
are O
rampant O
, O
of DEL
course DEL
, DEL
over DEL
the DEL
weekend DEL
, DEL
with O
some O
of O
the O
document O
leaked O
, O
that O
as DEL
much DEL
as-- DEL
as DEL
many DEL
as DEL
two O
or O
three O
members O
of O
the O
White O
House O
staff O
could DEL
be DEL
or DEL
might O
be O
recommended O
for O
criminal DEL
prosecution O
. O

And DEL
, DEL
of DEL
course DEL
, DEL
there O
's O
still DEL
this O
subterranean DEL
notion O
around DEL
that O
perhaps O
Mrs. DEL
Clinton-- DEL
Hillary O
Rodham O
Clinton O
herself DEL
, DEL
the DEL
first DEL
lady-- DEL
would O
be O
indicted O
if O
the O
allegations O
in O
this O
report O
are O
true O
. O

Do O
you O
believe O
that O
, O
Steve DEL
, DEL
or O
are O
you O
a DEL
little DEL
skeptical O
? O

You O
know DEL
, DEL
you DEL
just O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

It O
's O
so DEL
unprecedented O
, O
and O
so DEL
much O
of O
this O
has O
been O
coming O
out O
in O
dribs O
and O
drabs O
that O
it O
's O
just O
hard O
to O
tell O
. O

Certainly DEL
, DEL
between O
this O
and O
the O
FBI O
files O
and O
the O
next O
round O
of O
the O
trials O
on O
Whitewater O
down DEL
in DEL
Arkansas DEL
, O
the O
White O
House O
is O
going O
to O
be O
spending DEL
a DEL
lot DEL
of DEL
time DEL
on DEL
lawyers DEL
, DEL
and DEL
you DEL
do DEL
n't DEL
know DEL
how DEL
this DEL
will DEL
turn DEL
out DEL
, DEL
except DEL
they DEL
're DEL
going DEL
to DEL
be DEL
pinned DEL
down DEL
, DEL
doing O
more O
legal O
work O
, DEL
probably DEL
, DEL
than O
campaign O
work O
inside DEL
the DEL
White DEL
House DEL
. O

Whitewater O
's O
been O
one O
problem O
for O
the O
presidency O
. O

The O
other O
one O
, O
of DEL
course DEL
, DEL
reports O
about O
the O
FBI O
search O
of O
a DEL
number DEL
of DEL
people O
's O
records O
, O
including O
those O
of O
past O
Republican O
officials O
. O

Which O
one O
's O
hurting O
the O
president O
more O
at DEL
this DEL
point DEL
? O

I O
really DEL
think O
you O
're O
going O
to O
see O
more O
damage O
from O
the O
files O
and O
the O
FBI O
information O
that O
the O
White O
House O
retained O
. O

This O
is O
a O
breach O
that O
smells O
a DEL
lot-- DEL

All O
right O
. O

I DEL
regret DEL
that DEL
we O
have O
lost O
the O
ability O
to O
hear O
Steve O
; DEL
and O
, DEL
in DEL
consequence DEL
, DEL
we O
will O
have O
to O
live O
without O
knowing O
his O
answer O
to O
that O
particular O
question O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
, O
in DEL
a DEL
sense DEL
, DEL
because O
the O
president O
's O
having O
a O
difficult O
time O
in O
the O
public DEL
opinion DEL
polls O
anyway O
. O

We O
'll O
have O
Steve O
back O
next O
Monday O
morning DEL
to O
bring O
us O
a DEL
little DEL
bit DEL
more O
information O
. O

The O
Clinton O
administration O
has DEL
announced DEL
it DEL
is O
going O
to O
expand O
funding O
for O
an DEL
experimental DEL
program DEL
called DEL
the O
Brownfield O
Project O
[ DEL
sp DEL
] DEL
, O
designed O
to O
spur O
investment O
in O
abandoned O
industrial O
sites O
. O

Commentator O
John O
Chambers O
applauds O
the O
move O
. O

For O
15 DEL
years O
, O
I O
have O
practiced O
environmental O
law O
in O
Washington O
, O
D.C. O

My O
practice O
has O
taken O
me O
from O
the DEL
halls DEL
of DEL
Congress O
to O
the DEL
maze DEL
of DEL
offices DEL
at DEL
EPA O
's O
headquarters O
and O
into O
the O
federal O
courts O
that O
ultimately DEL
decide O
the O
validity O
of O
EPA O
's O
interpretation O
of O
its O
congressional O
mandates O
. O

In O
carrying O
out O
its O
role O
as O
primary DEL
protector O
of O
the O
environment O
, O
EPA O
dances O
to O
Congress O
' O
tune O
. O

Against DEL
this DEL
background DEL
, DEL
it O
is O
somewhat DEL
surprising O
that O
EPA O
would O
, DEL
on DEL
its DEL
own DEL
initiative DEL
, DEL
undertake O
a O
major DEL
new O
program O
as O
part O
of O
its O
brownfields O
action O
agenda O
. O

`` O
Brownfields O
' O
is O
a DEL
term DEL
used O
to O
refer O
to O
abandoned DEL
industrial O
sites O
that O
are O
no O
longer O
in O
productive DEL
use O
due O
to O
environmental O
problems O
. O

They O
typically DEL
take O
the O
form O
of O
abandoned O
warehouses O
, O
factories O
or O
vacant O
, DEL
trash-strewn DEL
lots O
. O

Those O
of DEL
us DEL
who O
live O
or O
work O
in O
cities O
pass O
by O
them O
daily O
. O

The O
Government O
Accounting O
Office O
estimates O
that O
there O
are O
more O
than O
450,000 O
brownfield O
sites O
located DEL
across O
the O
country O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
sites O
are O
located O
in O
inner O
city O
communities O
where O
the O
population O
is O
primarily DEL
composed O
of O
poor O
and O
working O
class O
minority O
groups O
. O

The O
idea O
is O
to O
develop O
solutions O
to O
the O
problems O
of O
urban DEL
blight O
caused O
in DEL
part DEL
by O
environmental O
policies O
that O
discouraged O
private DEL
investment O
in O
areas O
that O
had O
been O
hurt O
by O
contaminants O
from DEL
old DEL
industrial DEL
operations DEL
. O

In O
addition O
to O
providing O
seed DEL
money O
for O
selected DEL
pilots O
, O
EPA O
set O
about O
the O
task O
of O
revising O
and O
clarifying O
its O
environmental O
clean-up O
and O
liability O
guidance O
to O
encourage O
buyers O
, O
lenders O
and O
developers O
to O
become O
involved O
in O
brownfield O
redevelopment DEL
projects O
. O

It O
also DEL
spearheaded O
changes O
to O
the O
regulations O
implementing O
the O
Community O
Reinvestment O
Act O
to O
encourage O
greater DEL
participation O
by O
financial O
institutions O
. O

The O
Clinton O
administration O
recently DEL
unveiled O
a O
new DEL
means O
to O
encourage O
brownfields O
redevelopment O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
tax O
incentive O
proposal O
. O

My DEL
15 O
years O
of O
practice DEL
as O
an O
environmental O
lawyer O
has O
taught O
me O
many O
things O
. O

I DEL
realize DEL
that DEL
our O
collective DEL
lack O
of O
appreciation O
for O
the O
environment O
in O
the O
past O
has O
caused O
many O
of O
the O
problems O
we O
have O
today O
. O

I DEL
also DEL
recognize DEL
that DEL
excessive O
regulation O
, DEL
especially DEL
in DEL
the DEL
area DEL
of DEL
environmental DEL
clean-ups DEL
can DEL
, DEL
and DEL
has O
, DEL
impeded O
progress O
that O
might O
otherwise DEL
have O
been O
undertaken O
voluntarily O
. O

EPA O
's O
brownfields DEL
action DEL
agenda O
represents DEL
an DEL
accommodation DEL
of DEL
interest DEL
in DEL
a DEL
way DEL
that DEL
creates O
incentives O
to O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
, O
not O
only O
for O
the O
environment O
, O
but O
for O
people O
hurt O
by O
the O
economic O
conditions O
that O
continue DEL
to DEL
prevail O
in O
many O
of O
the DEL
nation DEL
's DEL
poor O
communities O
. O

It O
is O
time O
for O
Congress O
to O
get O
into O
the O
act O
by O
providing O
sources DEL
of DEL
funding O
for O
an DEL
integrated DEL
approach DEL
to DEL
solving O
the O
growing DEL
problem O
of O
urban O

If O
federal DEL
legislation O
is O
passed O
to O
help O
the DEL
administration DEL
carry O
out O
its DEL
brownfields O
redevelopment O
initiatives O
, O
it O
will O
be O
one O
of O
those O
rare DEL

Aside DEL
from DEL
what DEL
Senator O
Dole DEL
alluded DEL
to DEL
, DEL
for DEL
the DEL
most DEL
part DEL
, DEL
Bob O
Dole O
ignored O
the O
Whitewater O
and O
FBI O
files O
- DEL
the DEL
controversies DEL
that DEL
is DEL
- DEL
as O
he O
spent O
a O
second O
straight DEL
day O
courting O
California O
voters O
. O

And DEL
, DEL
as DEL
our DEL
Bruce DEL
Morton DEL
explains DEL
, DEL
Dole O
's O
strategy O
in O
the O
Golden O
State O
appears O
to O
be O
classic O
, O
as O
in O
the O
best O
Republican O
office O
is O
promoting O
a O
stronger O
defense O
. O

This O
Lockheed O
plant O
in O
Sunnyvale O
, DEL
California DEL
, DEL
is O
working O
on O
the O
THAD O
[ DEL
sp DEL
] DEL
missile O
, O
a O
more O
sophisticated O
version O
of O
the O
Patriot O
anti-missile O
used O
in O
the O
Gulf O
War O
. O

But O
employment O
is O
down O
to O
about DEL
10,000 O
, O
compared O
with O
25,000 O
in O
1986 O
. O

Dole O
accused O
President O
Clinton O
of O
dragging O
his O
feet O
on O
missile O
defense O
. O

Mr. O
Clintons O
opposition O
to O
a O
missile O
defense O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
negligent O
, O
short-sighted O
, O
irresponsible O
and O
potentially DEL
catastrophic O
policies O
in O
history O
. O

And DEL
Dole O
said O
it O
encourages O
terrorists O
to O
think O
about O
missile O
attacks O
. O

From O
Libya O
to O
Iraq O
to O
Iran O
to O
North O
Korea O
and O
elsewhere O
, O
a DEL
rogues DEL
gallery DEL
of DEL
terrorists O
and O
aggressive DEL
anti-American O
regimes O
, DEL
I DEL
believe DEL
, DEL
are O
in DEL
effect DEL
being O
encouraged O
by O
the O
administration O
's O
attitude O
. O

Dole O
made DEL
it DEL
clear DEL
that DEL
he DEL
would O
speed O
development O
of O
this O
plant O
's O
THAD O
and O
of O
missile O
defense O
in O
general O
. O

He O
also DEL
noted O
that O
people O
often DEL
do O
n't O
believe O
what O
politicians O
say O
and O
linked O
that O
with O
his O
decision O
to O
leave O
the O
U.S. DEL
Senate O
. O

I O
decided DEL
that DEL
I DEL
could O
put O
my O
career O
on O
the O
line O
, O
because O
I DEL
think DEL
America O
's O
future O
's O
on O
the O
line O
. O

That O
's O
how O
important O
it O
is. O

So DEL
I O
decided DEL
to DEL
role DEL
the DEL
dice DEL
, DEL
and DEL
I DEL
rolled O
the O
dice O
, O
and O
now O
it O
's O
up O
to O
you O
. O

Crowd O
reactions O
? O

Here O
are O
a O
few O
taken O
at O
random O
. O

The O
guy O
has O
some DEL
ideas O
. O

I O
think O
that O
's O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
with O
a DEL
lot DEL
of DEL
politicians O
today O
. O

They O
want O
to O
be O
president O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
really DEL
seem DEL
to DEL
have O
an O
idea O
what O
they O
want O
to O
do O
when O
they O
get O
there O
, DEL
except DEL
to DEL
be DEL
president DEL
. O

He O
's O
very DEL
down O
to O
earth O
and O
I DEL
thought DEL
was DEL
very DEL
true O
to O
what O
the O
American O
people O
really DEL
want O
. O

They O
want O
to O
have O
security O
in DEL
their DEL
lives DEL
. O

Earlier DEL
, DEL
Dole O
stopped O
to O
visit O
a O
volunteer O
fire O
station O
, O
noting O
that O
both O
his O
father O
and O
grandfather O
had O
been O
firefighters O
. O

Dole O
used O
this O
stop DEL
to O
say O
that O
Clinton O
's O
defense O
policies O
have O
hurt O
California O
. O

At O
other O
stops O
on DEL
this DEL
tour DEL
, O
he O
'll O
say O
other O
Clinton O
policies O
have O
done O
the O
same O
thing O
in O
other O
areas O
. O

From O
here O
, DEL
for DEL

, DEL
he O
goes O
to O
talk O
about O
agriculture O

very DEL

additional DEL

, DEL
although O

this O

it O

northeast DEL

that- O

St. O

McDonnell O

where O
the O

McDonnell O

right DEL

a O

a DEL

This O
, DEL
however DEL

this O

an O

And DEL
we O

No DEL

they O

at DEL

All DEL
they O

that DEL

All O

known DEL
as DEL
springo O

, O
which O
destroys O
the O

She O
described O
it O
as O
having O
hundreds O
or O
thousands O
of O
ice O
picks O
tearing O

She O
was O

OK. O

Detroit- DEL
excuse DEL
me DEL
, O
in DEL
Pontiac DEL

where O

confirmed O
the O
death O
and O
treated O
the O

with O
a DEL
lot DEL
of DEL
dignity O

respect O
and O
compassion O
. O

All DEL
right DEL
, DEL
Mr. DEL

, DEL
thank O
you O

much DEL

We O

The O
abortion O
issue O
is O
turning DEL
out DEL
to DEL
be DEL
especially DEL
divisive O
for O
Republicans O
in O
Texas O
. O

It DEL
appears DEL
the O
party O
there O
is O
headed O
for O
a O
showdown O
at O
the O
state O
convention O
. O

As DEL
our DEL
Paul DEL
Caron DEL
explains DEL
, DEL
the O
outcome O
will O
determine O
who O
will O
get DEL
to DEL
help O
to O
choose O
the O
party O
's O
nominee O
this O
August O
. O

Texas O
anti-abortion O
activists O
have O
taken O
a O
stand O
and O
drawn O
a O
line O
in O
the O
sand O
on O
the O
state O
Republican O
Party O
's O
position O
on DEL
abortion DEL
. O

This O
convention O
has O
decided O
to O
stand DEL
up DEL
and DEL
say O
, O
`` O
We O
're O
not O
sending O
pro-aborts O
to O
San O
Diego O
to O
fight DEL
to DEL
change O
our O
party DEL
platform O
. O

And DEL
the O
problem O
they O
face O
is O
Texas O
Senator O
Kay O
Bailey O
Hutchison O
. O

I DEL
think DEL
a O
tolerance O
provision O
is O
very DEL
important O
for O
the O
Republican O
Party O
. O

That O
has O
some O
Republicans O
wanting O
to O
block O
Hutchison O
out O
of O
the O
national O
convention O
as DEL
a DEL
delegate DEL
. O

She O
should O
be O
pushed O
out O
. O

I O
totally DEL
agree O
with O
that O
. O

If O
she O
's O
not O
for O
the O
family O
, O
that O
's O
what O
we O
're O
here O
for O
. O

Delegates O
were O
asked O
to O
sign O
this O
pledge O
by O
anti-abortion O
advocates O
seeking O
to O
send O
a DEL
majority DEL
of DEL
their O
own O
delegates O
to O
San O
Diego O
. O

But DEL
Hutchison O
has O
received O
a O
vote O
of O
confidence O
from O
the DEL
other DEL
Texas O
senator O
, DEL
Phil O
Gramm O
, DEL
who O
says O
, O
if O
Hutchison O
does O
n't O
go O
, O
neither O
will O
he O
. O

I DEL
think DEL
we O
have O
heard O
from O
a O
very DEL
small DEL
minority O
, O
and O
unfortunately DEL
, DEL
they O
're O
bullies O
. O

Bill O
Price O
, O
head O
of O
the O
Texans O
United O
for O
Life O
, O
has O
spearheaded O
the O
fight O
against O
Hutchison O
. O

In DEL
a DEL
reference DEL
to DEL
Gramm DEL
's DEL
low-budget DEL
Democratic DEL
challenger DEL
, DEL
Price O
says O
if O
Gramm O
does O
n't O
go O
, O
some O
in O
the O
party O
wo O
n't O
mind O
. O

Maybe DEL
he O
should O
buy O
a O
little DEL
white O
pickup O
and O
drive O
around O
Texas O
during O
the O
convention O
. O

Anti-abortion O
activists O
in O
other O
states O
have O
had O
success O
in O
getting O
a DEL
majority DEL
of DEL
their O
own O
delegates O
to O
the O
national O
convention O
. O

Hutchison O
could O
be O
the O
highest-ranking O
official O
to O
be O
shut O
out O
. O

State O
party O
elders O
are O
pleading O
for O
unity O
. O

We O
've O
got O
some DEL
differences O
, O
and O
I O
want O
to O
mediate- DEL
help O
mediate O
that O
dispute O
and O
see O
if O
we O
can O
come O
out O
united O
for O
November O
, DEL
and DEL
that DEL
's DEL
my DEL
goal DEL
. O

Texas O
Governor O
George O
W. O
Bush O
says O
he O
wo O
n't O
tolerate O
a O
fight O
or O
even DEL
an O
embarrassment O
of O
keeping O
Senator DEL
Hutchison O
out O
. O

There O
is O
no O
compromise O
as O
far O
as O
Kay O
Hutchison O
goes O
. O

She O
ought O
to O
be O
a O
delegate O
to O
the O
national DEL
convention O
. O

Hutchison O
's O
following O
here O
may O
still DEL
think O
Kay O
is O
OK O
, O
but O
the O
controversy O
is O
n't O
the O
running DEL
start O
the O
state O
Republicans O
wanted O
in DEL
heading DEL
to DEL
the DEL
national DEL
convention DEL
. O

Senator DEL
Hutchison O
did O
receive O
a O
warm O
welcome O
, DEL
though DEL
, DEL
from O
the O
crowd O
here O
. O

But DEL
some O
delegates O
say O
, O
since O
Bob O
Dole O
made O
his O
plea O
for O
tolerance O
on O
the O
abortion DEL
issue O
in O
the O
Republican O
Party O
, O
that DEL
the O
stakes O
for O
them O
are O
even DEL
higher O

, O

companies O
- O
they O
're O
all DEL
issuing O
high-yield O
bonds O
at O
a O
frantic O
pace O
. O

The O
amount O
of O
junk O
issued O
so DEL
far DEL
this O
year O
is O
up O
72 O
percent O
from O
last O
year O
. O

Companies O
, DEL
especially DEL
media DEL
, DEL
telecommunications DEL
and DEL
cable DEL
, DEL
need O
money O
to O
fund O
growth O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
companies DEL
had O
done O
initial O
public O
offerings O
of O
stock O
last O
year O
. O

They O
are O
so O
capital-intensive O
though DEL
, O
they O
need O
more O
cash O
to O
go O
forward O

building DEL
cable DEL
and O
bringing DEL
television DEL

all- DEL
to- DEL

outperforming O

are O
chasing O
yield O
, O
but O
they O
're O
also O
looking O
for O
a O
way O
to O
diversify O
portfolios O
. O

When O
K-Mart O
recently DEL
issued O
$ O
1 O
billion O
of O
convertible O
preferred O

that O
yielded O
7.75 O

, O
buyers O
were O
waiting O
in O

. O

What O
makes O
a O
more O
efficient O
portfolio O
, O
to O
add O
this O
asset O
class O
to O
an O
existing O
portfolio O
. O

And DEL
, DEL
we O
're O
seeing O
some O
of O
that O
, DEL
we DEL
believe DEL
, DEL
in- DEL
in O
terms O
of O
these DEL
very DEL
high O
weekly O
cash O
flows O
into O
the O
high-yield O
sector O
of O
the O

market O
. O

Quality O
is O
getting O
better O
in O
the O
high-yield O
sector O
. O

That O
's O
because O
corporate O
cash O
flows O
are O
improving O
due DEL
to DEL
a DEL
strong DEL
economy DEL
. O

Experts O
say O
this O
year O

pace O
is O
not O
likely O
to O
beat O
the O
record O
reached O
in O
1993 O
, O

investor O
demand O
will O
remain O
robust O

looking O
into O
whether O

Earlier DEL
this DEL

in O
a O

with O

, O
the O

said O
it O
boosted O

$ O
350 O

. O

The O
problem O
- O
that O
conference O

took O
place O
before O
the O

closed O
. O

The O
news O
was O
not O
released O
to DEL
the DEL
public DEL
until O
after O
the O

That O
, DEL

Hello DEL
, DEL
I O
'm O
Carolyn O
O'Neil O
and O
welcome O
to O
On O
The O
Menu O
. O

You DEL
know DEL
with O
summer O
officially DEL
upon O
us O
, O
it O
's O
time O
to O
head O
outdoors O
and O
fire O
up O
the O
backyard O
grill O
. O

It DEL
not DEL
only DEL
gets DEL
you DEL
out DEL
of DEL
that DEL
hot DEL
kitchen DEL
, DEL
but DEL
according O
to O
the O
Barbecue O
Industry O
Association O
, O
91 O
percent O
of O
folks O
say O
that DEL
they O
like O
to O
cook O
outdoors O
because O
they O
love O
the DEL
taste DEL
of DEL
grilled O
foods O
. O

But DEL
cooking O
outside O
means O
moving DEL
further DEL
from DEL
the DEL
refrigerator DEL
and DEL
that DEL
means DEL
you O
have O
to O
pay O
closer DEL
attention O
to O
summer DEL
food O
safety O
. O

It O
's O
summertime O
and O
the O
grilling O
's O
easy O
. O

But DEL
whether DEL
you DEL
're DEL
flipping DEL
fish DEL
or DEL
a DEL
backyard DEL
burger DEL
, DEL
summer O
is O
no O
time O
to O
relax O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
food O
safety O
. O

It DEL
's DEL
not DEL
clear DEL
whether DEL
picnicking DEL
and DEL
backyard DEL
cookouts DEL
are DEL
to DEL
blame DEL
, DEL
but DEL
according O
to O
the O
United O
States O
Department O
of O
Agriculture O
, O
there O
is O
an O
increase O
in O
reported DEL
cases DEL
of DEL
many DEL
food-borne O
illnesses O
between O
May O
and O
September O
. O

So DEL
to O
keep O
summer O
foods O
safe O
, O
here O
are O
some O
timely DEL
tips O
. O

When O
cooking O
ground O
beef O
, O
make O
sure O
it O
's O
thoroughly O
cooked O
. O

Undercooked O
hamburger O
can O
be O
a O
source O
of O
the DEL
deadly DEL
bacteria DEL
E. O
coli O
0157H7 O
. O

It O
's O
very DEL
difficult O
to O
test O
the O
temperature DEL
, DEL
the DEL
internal O
temperature O
of O
a O
hamburger O
. O

So DEL
the O
best O
surrogate O
that DEL
we DEL
've DEL
found DEL
is O
the O
color O
of O
the O
meat O
and O
if O
you O
cook O
your DEL
hamburger DEL
or O
if DEL
you DEL
ask O
for O
your O
hamburger O
brown O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
you O
really DEL
cut O
your O
chances DEL
, DEL
your DEL
risk O
of O
getting O
E. O
Coli O
157H7 O
or O
some DEL
of DEL
the DEL
other O
E. O
coli O
. O

And DEL
with O
more O
than O
just DEL
burgers O
on O
the O
grill O
, O
it O
's O
important O
to O
pick O
up O
skills O
in O
cooking O
other O
meats O
. O

The O
Pork O
Producers O
Council O
recommends O
using O
a O
meat O
thermometer O
to O
make O
sure O
pork O
is O
cooked O
to O
an O
internal O
temperature O
of O
at DEL
least DEL
155 O
degrees O
. O

Then DEL
you O
can O
learn O
the O
tongue O
test O
. O

I O
will O
take O
my O
tongs O
or O
my O
fork O
and O
I DEL
'll DEL
simply DEL
touch O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
pork O
chop O
, DEL
as DEL
I DEL
'm DEL
doing DEL
here DEL
to DEL
this DEL
chop DEL
I DEL
just DEL
took DEL
off DEL
the DEL
grill DEL
. O

If O
there O
's O
a O
little DEL
bit O
of O
give O
, O
just DEL
like DEL
that DEL
, DEL
I DEL
know DEL
that DEL
they O
're O
done O
perfectly O
. O

If O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
give O
to DEL
the DEL
pork DEL
chop DEL
, O
that DEL
means DEL
you O
need O
to O
put O
it O
back O
on O
the O
grill O
and O
if O
it O
's O
real O
hard O
, O

Herod DEL

I DEL

What DEL
they O

of O
the O

I O

it DEL

Sunday O
will O
be O
a O
day O
for O
Greeks O
to O
remember O
their O
long-time DEL
former O
prime O
minister O
, O
Andreas O
Papandreou O
. O

He O
has O
died O
at O
the O
age O
of O
77 O
after O
months O
of O
failing O
health O
. O

CNN O
's O
David O
Compton O
now DEL
joins O
us O
with O
a O
look O
back O
at O
a O
colorful O
and O
controversial O
political O
figure O
. O

Andreas DEL
Papandreou O
was O
educated O
in DEL
the DEL
United DEL
States DEL
at O
Harvard O
. O

He DEL
became DEL
a DEL
power DEL
player DEL
in O
Greek DEL
politics DEL
in DEL
1974 O
, DEL
when DEL
he O
founded O
the O
socialist O
Pasok O
party O
. O

He O
would O
rule O
the O
socialists O
with DEL
an DEL
iron DEL
grip DEL
for O
more O
than O
two O
decades O
. O

In O
1981 O
, O
he O
took O
the O
nation O
by O
storm O
. O

His O
socialists O
came O
to O
power O
in O
a O
landslide O
election O
victory O
and O
Andreas DEL
Papandreou O
was O
Greek O
prime O
minister O
. O

At DEL
various DEL
times DEL
, DEL
he O
vowed O
to O
pull O
Greece O
out O
of O
NATO O
and O
the O
European O
Union O
, O
promises O
he O
never O
kept O
but O
which O
won O
him O
fanatical DEL
support O
at DEL
home DEL
. O

Health O
problems O
sapped O
some O
of O
his O
once DEL
boundless DEL
energy O
. O

He O
had O
open-heart O
surgery O
in O
London O
in O
1988 O
. O

After DEL
leaving DEL
the DEL
hospital DEL
, DEL
he O
arrived O
back O
in O
Greece O
in DEL
true DEL
Papandreou DEL
style DEL
- DEL
with O
his O
young O
mistress O
, O
a O
former O
airline O
flight O
attendant O
, DEL
at DEL
his DEL
side DEL
. O

He O
divorced O
his O
wife O
and O
declared O
this O
mistress O
the O
new O
first O
lady O
of DEL
Greece DEL
. O

He O
married O
her O
a O
year O
later O
. O

Scandals O
about O
his O
private O
life O
he O
could O
fight O
off. O

It DEL
was DEL
a O
political O
scandal O
that DEL
forced O
Papandreou O
out O
of O
power O
. O

In O
1989 O
, O
he O
was O
accused O
of O
helping O
to O
embezzle O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
dollars O
. O

With O
the O
scandal O
hanging DEL
over DEL
his DEL
head DEL
, O
and O
the O
economy O
turning O
sour O
, O
the O
socialists O
fell O
out O
of O
favor O
and O
Papandreou O
became O
Greece O
's O
former O
prime O
minister O
. O

It O
was O
a O
title O
he O
would O
not O
hold O
for O
long O
. O

In O
1992 O
, O
he O
was O
cleared O
of DEL
any DEL
connection DEL
to DEL
the O
financial O
scandal O
and O
was O
once DEL
again O
elected O
prime O
minister O
. O

But DEL
time O
had O
mellowed O
the DEL
fiery DEL
Papandreou O
. O

He O
still O
knocked O
heads O
with O
European O
and O
U.S. O
leaders O
, O
but O
his O
rhetoric O
had O
been O
toned O
down O
. O

He O
even DEL
began O
to O
court O
the O
approval DEL
and DEL
economic O
help O
of O
other O
Western O
nations O
, O
and O
talked O
of O
privatizing O
some DEL
state-run O
industries O
. O

In O
his O
final O
years O
, O
Papandreou O
shied O
away O
from O
public O
appearances O
and O
Cabinet O
meetings O
became O
less O
and DEL
less DEL
frequent O
. O

In DEL
the DEL
end DEL
, DEL
it O
was O
failing O
health O
, O
not O
political O
rivals O
, O
that O
ended O
the O
Papandreou O
era O

The O
fuss O
over O
secret O
FBI O
files O
inside O
the O
White O
House O
grew O
louder O
today O
. O

One O
key DEL
Republican O
now DEL
contends O
some O
of O
the O
records O
contain O
private O
taxpayer O
documents O
. O

If O
true O
, O
some O
White DEL
House DEL
staffers O
could O
face O
criminal O
inquiries O
. O

A O
post-Watergate DEL
law O
makes O
it O
illegal O
for O
anyone O
to O
look O
at O
your O
tax O
papers O
without O
permission O
. O

CNN DEL
's DEL
Mark O
Feldstein O
looks O
into O
this O
growing DEL
election-year DEL
embarrassment O
for O
the O
White O
House O
. O

Secret DEL
files O
obtained O
by O
the O
White O
House O
on O
officials O
from O
Republican O
administrations O
allegedly DEL
included O
IRS O
as O
well O
as O
FBI O
records O
. O

In DEL
a DEL
letter DEL
to DEL
FBI DEL
Director DEL
Louis DEL
Freeh DEL
, DEL
Republican O
Senator O
Charles O
Grassley O
says O
his O
Judiciary DEL
Committee DEL
staff O
discovered O
IRS O
documents O
while O
reviewing O
the O
controversial DEL
files O
. O

Grassley O
wants O
an O
explanation O
. O

The O
FBI O
declined O
to O
comment O
to DEL
CNN. DEL

White O
House O
Spokesman O
Mark O
Fabiani O
said O
he O
does O
n't O
know O
if O
any O
of O
the O
disputed DEL
files O
also DEL
include O
confidential O
tax O
information O
, O
because O
the O
White O
House O
has O
now DEL
returned O
all O
of DEL
its DEL
files O
to O
the O
FBI O
. O

FBI O
files O
are O
one O
thing O
- O
that O
's O
bad O
enough O
. O

But DEL
IRS O
files O
are O
worse O
. O

Don O
Alexander O
was O
the O
IRS O
commissioner O
under O
President DEL
Richard O
Nixon O
. O

Nixon O
used O
the O
IRS O
to O
dig O
up O
dirt O
on O
political DEL
opponents O
. O

Alexander O
then DEL
helped O
pass O
post-Watergate O
reforms O
to O
prevent O
that O
from O
happening O
again O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
some DEL
clowns O
in O
the O
White O
House O
, DEL
however DEL
high DEL
they DEL
might DEL
be DEL
, DEL
to O
go O
back O
to O
some DEL
days O
that DEL
I O
thought O
were O
finished O
forever DEL
in DEL
this DEL
country DEL
. O

I O
was O
dumb O
enough DEL
and O
naive O
enough DEL
to O
believe O
that O
Watergate O
and O
some O
of O
its O
abuses O
could O
not O
happen O
again O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
question O
that O
belief O
. O

It O
's O
unclear O
exactly DEL
what O
IRS O
records O
actually DEL
made O
their O
way O
to O
the O
White O
House O
, O
how O
many O
files O
are O
involved O
, O
or O
how O
they O
got O
there O
in DEL
the DEL
first DEL
place DEL
. O

Officials O
are O
still DEL
trying O
to O
track O
all DEL
of DEL
the O
FBI DEL
files O
that O
ended O
up O
at O
the O
White O
House O
. O

Last DEL
week DEL
, DEL
a O
source O
close DEL
to DEL
former DEL
White DEL
House DEL
security DEL
chief DEL
Craig DEL
Livingstone DEL
told O
CNN O
that O
the O

released O
the O
names O
of O
at O

five O
other O
key DEL
Republicans O
whose O
FBI O
files O
they O
obtained O
. O

The O
White O
House O
says O
it O

turned O
over O
everything O
it O

. O

On DEL
Monday DEL
, DEL
Republican O
Congressman O
William O
Clinger O
requested O
that O
the O

still DEL
more O
documents O
on O
the O

It O
all O

up O

this O

Two O
