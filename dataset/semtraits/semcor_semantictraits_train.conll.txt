But	O

as	O
Scripture	Mental
everywhere	O
reminds	Mental
us	O

God	Animate

have	Mental

the	O

the	O

presents	Mental

And	O
yet	O
this	O
is	UnboundedEvent
exactly	O
the	O
risk	UnboundedEvent
we	O
run	UnboundedEvent
when	O
we	O
assume	Mental
,	O
as	O
we	O
too	O
often	O
do	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
continue	Mental

preach	Mental
the	O
gospel	Mental

form	Mental
that	O
makes	BoundedEvent
it	O
seem	Mental
incredible	O
and	O
irrelevant	O
to	O

Until	O
we	O
translate	Mental
this	O

we	O

the	O

In	O
arguing	Mental
in	O
this	O
way	Property
,	O
we	O
are	O
obviously	O
taking	Mental
for	O

that	O
a	O
demythologized	O
restatement	Mental
of	O
the	O
kerygma	Mental
can	O
be	O
achieved	Agentive

and	O
that	O
we	O
firmly	O
believe	Mental
this	O

presently	O

when	O
we	O
set	Mental
forth	Mental
reasons	Mental

justify	Mental
such	O
a	O

But	O
the	O
main	O
point	Mental
here	O
is	UnboundedEvent
that	O
even	O
if	O
such	O
a	O

were	UnboundedEvent
not	O
possible	O

the	O
demand	Mental

This	O

what	O
we	O
mean	Mental

we	O

this	O

be	O
accepted	Mental

If	O

the	O

anything	O

then	O
my	O
only	O
choice	Mental
is	UnboundedEvent
to	O
refuse	Mental

Expressed	Mental

if	O
the	O

To	O

that	O
even	O
centuries	Mental

Our	O

But	O

The	O

Thus	O

Therefore	O

**f	O

Thus	O

For	O
what	O
I	O
express	Mental

my	O
remark	Mental
is	UnboundedEvent
something	O
going	UnboundedEvent
on	UnboundedEvent
in	O
me	O
at	O
the	O
time	Mental

and	O
that	O
of	O
course	O
did	O
not	O
exist	UnboundedEvent
until	O
I	O
did	O
come	BoundedEvent
on	BoundedEvent
the	O
scene	Object

The	O
pain	UnboundedEvent
of	O
the	O
rabbit	Animate
was	UnboundedEvent
not	O
itself	O
bad	O
;	O
nothing	Mental
evil	O

badness	Property

in	O
the	O

sense	Mental

which	O
it	O

all	O

waited	UnboundedEvent
for	O
its	O
appearance	BoundedEvent
till	O
I	O
came	BoundedEvent
and	O
looked	Mental
and	O
felt	Mental

Now	O
that	O
this	O
is	UnboundedEvent
at	O
odds	O
with	O
our	O
meaning	Mental
may	O
be	O
shown	Mental
as	O
follows	O

Let	Agentive
us	O
put	UnboundedEvent
to	O
ourselves	O
the	O
hypothesis	Mental
that	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
come	BoundedEvent
on	BoundedEvent
the	O
scene	Object
and	O
that	O
the	O
rabbit	Animate
never	O
was	O
discovered	Mental
.	O

Are	UnboundedEvent
we	O
prepared	O
to	O
say	Mental
that	O
in	O
that	O
case	UnboundedEvent
nothing	Mental
bad	O
occurred	BoundedEvent
in	O
the	O
sense	Mental
in	O
which	O
we	O
said	Mental
it	O
did	O
?	O

Clearly	O
not	O
.	O

Indeed	O
we	O
should	O
say	Mental
,	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
accident	BoundedEvent
of	O
our	O
later	O
discovery	Agentive
made	Agentive
no	O
difference	Property
whatever	O
to	O
the	O
badness	Property
of	O
the	O
animal	Animate
's	O
pain	UnboundedEvent
,	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	UnboundedEvent
every	O
whit	Mental
as	O
bad	O
whether	O
a	O
chance	O
passer-by	Animate
happened	BoundedEvent
later	O
to	O
discover	Mental
the	O
body	Object
and	O
feel	Mental
repugnance	Mental
or	O
not	O
.	O

If	O
so	O
,	O
then	O
it	O
is	UnboundedEvent
clear	O
that	O
in	O
saying	Mental
the	O
suffering	UnboundedEvent
was	UnboundedEvent
bad	O
we	O
are	O
not	O
expressing	Mental
our	O
feelings	Mental
only	O
.	O

We	O
are	O
saying	Mental
that	O
the	O
pain	UnboundedEvent
was	UnboundedEvent
bad	O
when	O
and	O
as	O
it	O
occurred	BoundedEvent
and	O
before	O
anyone	O
took	BoundedEvent
an	O
attitude	Mental
toward	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
argument	Mental
is	UnboundedEvent
thus	O
an	O
ideal	O
experiment	Agentive
in	O
which	O
we	O
use	Agentive
the	O
method	Mental
of	O
difference	Property
.	O

It	O
removes	BoundedEvent
our	O
present	O
expression	Mental
and	O
shows	Mental
that	O
the	O
badness	Property
we	O
meant	Mental
would	O
not	O
be	O
affected	BoundedEvent
by	O
this	O
,	O
whereas	O
on	O
positivist	O
grounds	Mental
it	O
should	O
be	O
.	O

The	O
second	O
argument	Mental
applies	Agentive
the	O
method	Mental
in	O
the	O
reverse	O
way	Property
.	O

It	O
ideally	O
removes	BoundedEvent
the	O
past	O
event	BoundedEvent
,	O
and	O
shows	Mental
that	O
this	O
would	O
render	BoundedEvent
false	O
what	O
we	O
mean	Mental
to	O
say	Mental
,	O
whereas	O
on	O
positivist	O
grounds	Mental
it	O
should	O
not	O
.	O

Let	Agentive
us	O
suppose	Mental
that	O
the	O
animal	Animate
did	O
not	O
in	O
fact	O
fall	BoundedEvent
into	O
the	O
trap	Object
and	O
did	O
not	O
suffer	BoundedEvent
at	O
all	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
mistakenly	O
believe	Mental
it	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
say	Mental
as	O
before	O
that	O
its	O
suffering	UnboundedEvent
was	UnboundedEvent
an	O
evil	O
thing	UnboundedEvent
.	O

On	O
the	O
positivist	O
theory	Mental
,	O
everything	O
I	O
sought	Agentive
to	O
express	Mental
by	O
calling	Mental
it	O
evil	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
case	BoundedEvent
is	UnboundedEvent
still	O
present	O
in	O
the	O
second	O

In	O
the	O
only	O
sense	Mental
in	O
which	O
badness	Property
is	O
involved	UnboundedEvent
at	O
all	O

whatever	O
was	UnboundedEvent
bad	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
case	BoundedEvent
is	UnboundedEvent
still	O

in	O
its	O

since	O
all	O

either	O

a	O
state	UnboundedEvent
of	O
feeling	Mental

that	O

there	O

And	O
our	O
question	Mental
is	UnboundedEvent

is	UnboundedEvent
such	O
an	O
implication	Mental
consistent	O
with	O
what	O
we	O
meant	Mental

Clearly	O
it	O
is	UnboundedEvent
not	O

If	O
anyone	O
asked	Mental
us	O
,	O
after	O
we	O
made	Agentive
the	O
remark	Mental
that	O
the	O
suffering	UnboundedEvent
was	UnboundedEvent
a	O
bad	O
thing	UnboundedEvent
,	O
whether	O
we	O
should	O
think	Mental
it	O
relevant	O
to	O
what	O
we	O
said	Mental
to	O
learn	Mental
that	O
the	O
incident	BoundedEvent
had	O
never	O
occurred	BoundedEvent
and	O
no	O
pain	UnboundedEvent
had	O
been	O
suffered	Mental
at	O
all	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
say	Mental
that	O
it	O
made	Agentive
all	O
the	O
difference	BoundedEvent
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
that	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
asserting	Mental
to	O
be	UnboundedEvent
bad	O
was	UnboundedEvent
precisely	O
the	O
suffering	UnboundedEvent
we	O
thought	Mental
had	O
occurred	BoundedEvent
back	O
there	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
this	O
had	O
not	O
occurred	BoundedEvent
,	O
there	O
was	UnboundedEvent
nothing	Mental
left	BoundedEvent
to	O
be	UnboundedEvent
bad	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
our	O
assertion	Mental
was	UnboundedEvent
in	O
that	O
case	BoundedEvent
mistaken	O
.	O

The	O
suggestion	Mental
that	O
in	O
saying	Mental
something	O
evil	O
had	O
occurred	BoundedEvent
we	O
were	O
after	O
all	O
making	Agentive
no	O
mistake	Mental

because	O
we	O
had	O
never	O
meant	Mental
anyhow	O
to	O
say	Mental
anything	O
about	O
the	O
past	O
suffering	UnboundedEvent
,	O
seems	Mental
to	O
me	O
merely	O
frivolous	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
mean	Mental
to	O
say	Mental
this	O
,	O
why	O
should	O
we	O
be	O
so	O
relieved	BoundedEvent
on	O
finding	Mental
that	O
the	O
suffering	UnboundedEvent
had	O
not	O
occurred	BoundedEvent
?	O

On	O
the	O
theory	Mental
before	O
us	O
,	O
such	O
relief	Mental
would	O
be	UnboundedEvent
groundless	O
,	O
for	O
in	O
that	O
suffering	UnboundedEvent
itself	O
there	O
was	UnboundedEvent
nothing	Mental
bad	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
hence	O
in	O
its	O
nonoccurrence	UnboundedEvent
there	O
would	O
be	UnboundedEvent
nothing	Mental
to	O
be	O
relieved	BoundedEvent
about	O
.	O

The	O
positivist	O
theory	Mental
would	O
here	O
distort	Mental
our	O
meaning	Mental
beyond	O
recognition	Mental
.	O

So	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
can	O
see	Agentive
,	O
there	O
is	O
only	O
one	O
way	Object
out	Object
for	O
the	O
positivist	Animate
.	O

He	O
holds	Mental
that	O
goodness	Property
and	O
badness	Property
lie	UnboundedEvent
in	UnboundedEvent
feelings	Mental
of	O
approval	Mental
or	O
disapproval	Mental
.	O

And	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
way	Agentive
in	O
which	O
he	O
might	O
hold	Mental
that	O
badness	Property
did	O
in	O
this	O
case	UnboundedEvent
precede	UnboundedEvent
our	O
own	O
feeling	Mental
of	O
disapproval	Mental
without	O
belonging	UnboundedEvent
to	UnboundedEvent
the	O
pain	UnboundedEvent
itself	O
.	O

The	O
pain	UnboundedEvent
in	O
itself	O
was	UnboundedEvent
neutral	O
;	O
but	O
unfortunately	O
the	O
rabbit	Animate
,	O
on	O
no	O
grounds	Mental
at	O
all	O
,	O
took	Mental
up	Mental
toward	O
this	O
neutral	O
object	Mental
an	O
attitude	Mental
of	O
disapproval	Mental
and	O
that	O
made	BoundedEvent
it	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
only	O
intelligible	O
sense	Mental
,	O
bad	O
.	O

This	O
way	Agentive
of	O
escape	Agentive
is	UnboundedEvent
theoretically	O
possible	O
,	O
but	O
since	O
it	O
has	Mental
grave	O
difficulties	Property
of	O
its	O
own	O
and	O
has	O
not	O
,	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
know	Mental
,	O
been	UnboundedEvent
urged	Mental
by	O
positivists	Animate
,	O
it	O
is	UnboundedEvent
perhaps	O
best	O
not	O
to	O
spend	Mental
time	Mental
over	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
come	BoundedEvent
now	O
to	O
a	O
third	O
argument	Mental
,	O
which	O
again	O
is	UnboundedEvent
very	O
simple	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
come	Mental
upon	Mental
the	O
rabbit	Animate
and	O
make	Agentive
our	O
remark	Mental
about	O
its	O
suffering	UnboundedEvent
being	UnboundedEvent
a	O
bad	O
thing	UnboundedEvent
,	O
we	O
presumably	O
make	Agentive
it	O
with	O
some	O
feeling	Mental
;	O
the	O
positivists	Animate
are	UnboundedEvent
plainly	O
right	O
in	O
saying	Mental
that	O
such	O
remarks	Mental
do	Agentive
usually	O
express	Mental
feeling	Mental
.	O

But	O
suppose	Mental
that	O
a	O
week	Mental
later	O
we	O
revert	BoundedEvent
to	O
the	O
incident	BoundedEvent
in	O
thought	Mental
and	O
make	Agentive
our	O
statement	Mental
again	O
.	O

And	O
suppose	Mental
that	O
the	O
circumstances	UnboundedEvent
have	O
now	O
so	O
changed	BoundedEvent
that	O
the	O
feeling	Mental
with	O
which	O
we	O
made	Agentive
the	O
remark	Mental
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
has	O
faded	BoundedEvent

The	O
pathetic	O
evidence	Mental
is	UnboundedEvent
no	O
longer	O
before	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
are	UnboundedEvent
now	O
so	O
fatigued	O
in	O
body	Object

mind	Mental
that	O
feeling	Mental
is	UnboundedEvent

as	O
we	O

quite	O

In	O
these	O
circumstances	UnboundedEvent

since	O
what	O
was	O
expressed	Mental

the	O
remark	Mental

the	O
theory	Mental

the	O
remark	Mental

nothing	Mental

It	O
is	UnboundedEvent
as	O
empty	O
as	O
the	O
word	Mental
``	O

would	O
be	UnboundedEvent
when	O
there	O

no	O
enthusiasm	Mental

it	O

And	O
this	O
seems	Mental
to	O
me	O
untrue	O

When	O
we	O
repeat	Mental
the	O
remark	Mental
that	O
such	O
suffering	UnboundedEvent
was	UnboundedEvent
a	O
bad	O
thing	UnboundedEvent
,	O
the	O
feeling	Mental
with	O
which	O
we	O

it	O
last	O

may	O
be	UnboundedEvent
at	O
or	O

the	O
vanishing	Object
point	Object

but	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
asked	Mental
whether	O
we	O

say	Mental
what	O
we	O
did	O
before	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
certainly	O
answer	Mental
Yes	O

We	O
should	O
say	Mental
that	O
we	O

our	O

the	O
first	O

that	O

And	O
if	O
we	O
can	O
see	Mental
that	O
what	O
we	O
meant	Mental
to	O
say	Mental
remains	BoundedEvent
the	O

while	O
the	O

it	O

the	O

I	O
come	BoundedEvent
now	O
to	O
a	O
fourth	O
consideration	Mental

We	O

on	O
the	O

such	O

Broad	Animate

that	O

whether	O

Let	Agentive

In	O
his	O

The	O

Dostoevsky	Animate

Whatever	O
the	O

Dostoevsky	Animate

``	O

If	O
we	O
were	O
asked	Mental
why	O
we	O

we	O
should	O
say	Mental
that	O
these	O

that	O

plainly	O

Now	Mental
on	O
the	O
subjectivist	Animate
view	Mental

this	O
answer	Mental
is	O
ruled	UnboundedEvent
out	UnboundedEvent

For	O
before	O
someone	Animate
takes	Mental
up	Mental
an	O
attitude	Mental
toward	O
death	Mental

suffering	UnboundedEvent

or	O
their	O
infliction	Agentive

they	O
have	UnboundedEvent
no	O
moral	O
quality	Property

all	O

There	O
is	O
therefore	O
nothing	Mental
about	O
them	O
to	O
which	O
an	O
attitude	Mental
of	O
approval	Mental

could	O
be	UnboundedEvent

They	O
are	UnboundedEvent

themselves	O
neutral	O

so	O

as	O
they	O
get	Mental
a	O

they	O
get	Mental
it	O

through	O

it	O

the	O

But	O
if	O
that	O

Would	O

the	O

Bobby	Animate

,	O
not	O
coming	BoundedEvent

dinner	Object

sometimes	O

When	O
they	O

he	O

all	O

she	O

get	BoundedEvent

the	O

drive	BoundedEvent

he	O
was	O
working	Agentive

to	O
take	BoundedEvent
him	O
a	O
fresh	O

Now	Mental
there	O
was	UnboundedEvent
no	O

the	O

nor	O
would	O
there	O
be	UnboundedEvent

she	O

not	O
know	Mental
where	O
he	O

Not	O
that	O
she	O
complained	Mental

had	Mental

cause	Mental

Four	Mental

five	Mental
of	O
the	O
cousins	Animate
from	O
East	Object
Texas	Object
were	UnboundedEvent
about	O
his	O

so	O
naturally	O
they	O
ran	BoundedEvent
around	BoundedEvent

There	O
was	UnboundedEvent
no	O
reason	Mental
for	O
her	O
to	O
ask	Mental
what	O
they	O
did	Agentive

Thus	O
a	O
new	O
pattern	Agentive
of	O
days	Mental
began	BoundedEvent
to	O
develop	BoundedEvent
,	O
for	O
Granny	Animate
Albright	Animate
did	O
not	O
die	BoundedEvent

She	O
lay	UnboundedEvent

the	O

her	O

hardly	O
denting	UnboundedEvent

sometimes	O
she	O
opened	UnboundedEvent
her	O
eyes	Object

looked	Mental
around	Mental
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
she	O
took	Agentive
a	O
little	O
milk	Object
or	O
soup	Object

They	O
stopped	UnboundedEvent
expecting	Mental
her	O
to	O
die	BoundedEvent
the	O
next	O
minute	Mental
,	O
but	O
only	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
day	Mental
or	O
two	O
.	O

Those	O
who	O
had	O
driven	BoundedEvent
hundreds	Mental
of	O
miles	Mental
for	O
the	O
burial	BoundedEvent
would	O
not	O
go	BoundedEvent
home	BoundedEvent

for	O
she	O
might	O
die	BoundedEvent
any	O

but	O
they	O
might	O

well	O
unpack	UnboundedEvent
their	O

she	O

linger	UnboundedEvent

the	O

The	O

This	O

His	O

the	O

Another	O

Plus	O
the	O
