ODbL Plain Language Summary
===========================

This summary is not a license.  It is simply a handy reference
for understanding the ODbL 1.0 -- a human-readable expression
of some of its key terms.  Read the full ODbL 1.0 license text
(see LICENSE / odbl-10.txt) for the exact terms that apply.

You are free:

 - To Share:  To copy, distribute and use the database.
 - To Create: To produce works from the database.
 - To Adapt:  To modify, transform and build upon the database.

As long as you:

 - Attribute: You must attribute any public use of the database,
              or works produced from the database, in the manner
              specified in the ODbL.  For any use or re-
              distribution of the database, or works produced
              from it, you must make clear to others the license
              of the database and keep intact any notices on
              the original database.

 - Share-Alike: If you publicly use any adapted version of
                this database, or works produced from an adapted
                database, you must also offer that adapted
                database under the ODbL.

 - Keep open: If you redistribute the database, or an adapted
              version of it, then you may use technological
              measures that restrict the work (such as DRM)
              as long as you also redistribute a version
              without such measures.

   Profiting from Mark-Up: Hyper-Text Annotations for Guided Parsing.
   In Proceedings of the 48th Annual Meeting of the

Primary Files
=============

Mark-up information in BLOGp and BLOGt is appended to POS tags,
e.g., the suffix "<i>2" indicates that the token in question is
a member of the second(2) piece of mark-up, which is italics(i).

- dp.charniak        -- the fully annotated blog (BLOGp)
- dp.info            -- a full analysis of every sentence;
                        table summaries towards the end...

- dp.stanford        -- unparsed but tagged blog (BLOGt)
- dp.model.dmv       -- the converged model of BLOGt-best


Secondary Files
===============

Intermediate and other representations not specifically discussed
or promised in the paper, but which may nevertheless be of use.

- dp.stanford.select -- same as above,
- dp.charniak.select    but just for marked,
- dp.info.select        complete sentences

- dp.xin             -- raw input X/HTML
- dp.xout            -- semi-automatically corrected output X/HTML
- dp.jmx             -- sentence-breaking, according to MX-terminator
- dp.plain           -- our final, semi-automatically fixed-up sentences
- dp.sent            -- sentences suitable for running the Charniak's parser
- dp.parsed          -- the output from Charniak's parser (BLOGp - mark-up)
- dp.tagged          -- the output of the Stanford tagger (BLOGt - mark-up)
- dp.prep            -- clean sentences with all mark-up
- dp.mark            -- clean sentences with clean mark-up

- dp.raw.stanford    -- an uncleaned version of the data, sentence-broken
                        and tagged by the Stanford tagger, without any
                        manual intervention...

Enjoy!
