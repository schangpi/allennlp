It	O
increased	B-TARGET
during	O
the	O
elections	B-TARGET

Their	O
danger	B-TARGET

that	O
hundreds	B-TARGET

volunteered	B-TARGET
in	O
the	O

the	O

,	O
and	O
thousands	B-TARGET

renouncing	B-TARGET
their	O

After	O
we	O
took	O
a	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
situation	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
best	O
solutions	O
to	O
stop	O
thousands	O
of	O
people	O
from	O
renouncing	O
their	O
religion	O

is	O
to	O
cut	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

.	O

Before	O
we	O
start	O
reviewing	O
the	O
events	O
that	O
accured	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
ask	O
two	O
questions:	O

First	B-TARGET
:	O
If	O
there	O
were	O
people	B-TARGET
who	O
are	O
raping	B-TARGET
thousands	B-TARGET
of	O
Muslim	O
women	B-TARGET
taking	B-TARGET
their	O
honor	O
,	O
and	O
stealing	B-TARGET
muslim	O
money	B-TARGET
and	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
other	B-TARGET
people	B-TARGET
who	O
do	O
n't	O
rape	B-TARGET
or	O
steal	B-TARGET
,	O
but	O
they	O
take	B-TARGET
the	O
religion	O
away	O
from	O
thousands	B-TARGET
of	O
Muslims	B-TARGET
,	O
what	O
's	O
more	B-TARGET
important	B-TARGET
,	O
religion	O
,	O
or	O
honor	O
and	O
land	O
?	O

What	O
we	O
learned	B-TARGET
from	O
Muslim	O
scholars	O
is	O
that	O
robbing	B-TARGET
the	O
religion	O
from	O
Muslims	B-TARGET
,	O
is	O
greater	O
than	O
robbing	B-TARGET
their	O
honor	O
and	O
land	O
.	O

God	O
said	B-TARGET
``	O
turmoil	O
is	O
greater	O
than	O
murder	B-TARGET
''	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
those	O
devils	O
,	O
their	O
danger	B-TARGET
is	O
greater	O
than	O
who	O
rapes	B-TARGET
,	O
or	O
rob	B-TARGET
and	O
steal	B-TARGET
money	B-TARGET
or	O
land	O
.	O

Second	O
question	O
:	O
Why	O
did	O
we	O
announce	O
and	O
started	O
fighting	O
the	O
Shiites	O
and	O
police	O
from	O
the	O
start	O
,	O
even	O
though	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
Jihadist	O
sectors	O
and	O
the	O
public	O
did	O
n't	O
understand	O
what	O
we	O
want	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
starting	O
with	O
those	O
?	O

So	O
what	O
's	O
the	O
objection	O
on	O
killing	O
and	O
executing	O
the	O
Sheiks	O
now	O
and	O
without	O
a	O
notice	O
,	O
with	O
continiuing	O
making	O
people	O
understand	O
it	O
,	O
just	O
like	O
we	O
did	O
by	O
killing	O
the	O
police	O
then	O
?	O

Were	O
people	O
satisfied	O
with	O
us	O
?	O

Actually	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
thinks	O
that	O
who	O
killed	O
the	O
police	O
is	O
Badr	O
organization	O
or	O
gangs	O
from	O
Iran	O
!	O

And	O
that	O
who	O
's	O
killing	O
Shiites	O
is	O
hired	O
by	O
Israel	O
and	O
the	O
U.S.	O
to	O
start	O
an	O
ethnic	O
war	O
and	O
so	O
on	O
.	O

From	O
what	O
we	O
saw	B-TARGET
,	O
the	O
damage	B-TARGET
caused	B-TARGET
by	O
those	O
erratic	O
infidels	O
(	O
Tribes	O
Sheiks	O
,	O
The	O
Islamic	O
Party	O
)	O
is	O
more	B-TARGET
dangerous	B-TARGET
than	O
the	O
Shiites	O
and	O
the	O
peaceful	O
police	O
as	O
people	B-TARGET
call	O
them	O
.	O

You	O

on	O
those	O
,	O
with	O
the	O

many	B-TARGET

of	O
decision	B-TARGET

The	O
brothers	B-TARGET
now	B-TARGET
are	O
wiping	O
out	O
the	O

as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
started	B-TARGET
,	O
and	O
never	B-TARGET

,	O
we	O
found	B-TARGET
among	O
us	O
who	O
wants	B-TARGET
to	O
make	O
fuss	O
about	B-TARGET
it	O
,	O
and	O
regretfully	O
some	B-TARGET
of	O
the	O
brothers	B-TARGET
with	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
organization	B-TARGET
(	O

see	B-TARGET
it	O

My	O

here	O

some	B-TARGET
of	O

That	O
's	O

That	O
's	O

,	O
you	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
that	O
it	O
seems	B-TARGET

the	O
automatic	O

-	O
if	O

if	O
a	O

you	O

sentence	B-TARGET
someone	O
for	O
between	B-TARGET
,	O
you	O
know	B-TARGET
,	O
two	B-TARGET

and	O
uh	O
fifty	B-TARGET
years	B-TARGET
and	O
you	O
know	B-TARGET
what	O
's	O
his	O
whim	O
to	O
decide	O
it	O
should	B-TARGET
be	O
two	B-TARGET
months	B-TARGET
.	O

This	O
is	O
true	O
and	O
-	O
and	O
-	O
and	O
-	O
and	O
-	O
and	O
the	O
way	O
the	O
law	B-TARGET
reads	O
,	O
uh	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
sentence	B-TARGET
you	O
to	O
-	O

You	O
know	B-TARGET
it	O
's	O
crazy	B-TARGET
.	O

-	O
life	O
in	B-TARGET
prison	B-TARGET
then	O
he	O
's	O

If	O
it	O
's	O

a	O

then	O
he	O
's	O

So	O
what	O
,	O
you	O
know	B-TARGET
,	O
let	O
's	O
quit	B-TARGET
BSing	O
with	O
the	O

,	O
even	O
if	O
it	O

,	O
we	O
end	O
up	O
spending	O
sixty	B-TARGET

to	O
keep	B-TARGET
some	O
,	O
you	O
know	B-TARGET
,	O
joker	O
in	B-TARGET
there	O
for	O

I	O
tiptoed	O
down	O
the	O

and	O
stooped	O
behind	O
the	O
low	O
wall	O
which	O
surrounded	O
the	O

Creeping	O
in	O

I	O
reached	O
a	O
point	O

I	O
could	O
look	O
straight	O
through	O
the	O

There	B-TARGET

only	B-TARGET
two	B-TARGET

Sir	O
Henry	O

Stapleton	O

They	O
sat	B-TARGET

their	O
profiles	O
towards	O

on	B-TARGET
either	O
side	B-TARGET
of	O
the	O
round	O

Both	O

were	O
smoking	B-TARGET
cigars	O

and	O
coffee	B-TARGET

wine	O
were	O
in	O

of	O
them	O

Stapleton	O
was	O
talking	B-TARGET
with	O
animation	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
baronet	O
looked	B-TARGET
pale	O
and	O
distrait	O

Perhaps	O
the	O
thought	B-TARGET
of	O
that	O
lonely	O
walk	B-TARGET
across	O
the	O
ill	O

weighing	O
heavily	O
upon	O

As	O
I	O
watched	B-TARGET

Stapleton	O
rose	B-TARGET

left	B-TARGET
the	O

filled	B-TARGET

leaned	B-TARGET
back	O
in	B-TARGET

chair	O

puffing	B-TARGET
at	O
his	O
cigar	O

I	O
heard	B-TARGET
the	O
creak	B-TARGET
of	O
a	O
door	B-TARGET
and	O
the	O
crisp	O
sound	B-TARGET
of	O
boots	B-TARGET
upon	B-TARGET

The	O

passed	B-TARGET

the	O

the	O

I	O

the	O

as	O

was	O
only	O
a	O

inside	B-TARGET

bounds	O

down	O

following	O
hard	O

both	O

the	O

him	O
down	O

But	O
that	O
cry	O

from	O

blown	O
all	O

Sir	O

the	O
deep	O

of	O
the	O

I	O

the	O

With	O

this	O

is	O
exceedingly	O
simple	O
,	O
it	O
appears	B-TARGET
to	O
explain	B-TARGET
several	B-TARGET
things	O
.	O

First	B-TARGET
,	O
why	B-TARGET
ticket	O
splitting	B-TARGET
has	O
increased	B-TARGET
and	O
taken	O
the	O
peculiar	O
pattern	B-TARGET
that	O
it	O
has	O
over	O
the	O
past	B-TARGET
half	O
century	B-TARGET
:	O
Prior	B-TARGET
to	O
the	O

voters	O
in	O

for	O
Congress	O
was	O
considerably	O
less	O
severe	O
.	O

Second	B-TARGET
,	O
it	O
explains	B-TARGET
why	O
voters	O
hold	O
Congress	O
in	O
disdain	B-TARGET
but	B-TARGET
generally	O
love	B-TARGET
their	O
own	O
congressional	O
representatives	B-TARGET
:	O
Any	B-TARGET
individual	O
legislator	B-TARGET
's	O
constituents	O
appreciate	B-TARGET
the	O
specific	O
benefits	O
that	O
the	O
legislator	B-TARGET

them	O
but	B-TARGET
not	O
the	O
overall	O

likewise	O
for	O
his	O
own	O
constituency	O

Third	B-TARGET
,	O
the	O
theory	O
suggests	B-TARGET
why	O
legislators	B-TARGET

pay	O
too	O

attention	B-TARGET

immune	O
to	O
defeat	B-TARGET
.	O

The	O
one	B-TARGET
exception	O
to	O
this	O
recent	B-TARGET
trend	O
was	O
the	O
defeat	B-TARGET
of	B-TARGET
13	O
of	B-TARGET

Fourth	B-TARGET
,	O
the	O
theory	O
indicates	B-TARGET
why	O
the	O
Republican	O
Party	O
may	B-TARGET

a	O

time	O

To	O
the	O
extent	O
that	O

congressional	O

.	O

Fifth	B-TARGET
,	O
the	O
theory	O
may	B-TARGET
provide	B-TARGET
at	O
least	O
a	O
partial	O
reason	B-TARGET
for	O
why	O
ticket	O
splitting	B-TARGET
has	O
been	O
particularly	O
pronounced	O
in	B-TARGET
the	O
South	B-TARGET
.	O

To	O
the	O
extent	O
that	O
Democratic	O
legislators	B-TARGET
from	B-TARGET
the	O
South	O
have	O
held	O
a	O
disproportionate	O
share	O
of	B-TARGET
power	B-TARGET
in	B-TARGET
Congress	O
since	B-TARGET
1932	O
and	O
have	O
been	O
able	B-TARGET

Finally	O

the	O
theory	O
