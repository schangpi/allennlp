until	O
the	O

of	O
their	O
fulfilment	O
.	O

Partly	O
it	O
came	O
no	O

from	O
his	O
own	O
masterful	O
nature	O
,	O
which	O
loved	O
to	O
dominate	O
and	O
surprise	O
those	O
who	O
were	O
around	O
him	O

Partly	O
also	O
from	O
his	O
professional	O
caution	O
,	O
which	O
urged	O
him	O
never	O
to	O
take	O
any	O

The	O
result	O

was	O
very	O

I	O

never	O
more	O

than	O

what	O

My	O

the	O

Every	O

of	O

taking	O
us	O
nearer	O
to	O
our	O
supreme	O
adventure	O

Our	O

was	O
hampered	O
by	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
the	O
driver	O
of	O
the	O

so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
relief	O

after	O
that	O
unnatural	O
restraint	O

when	O
we	O
at	O

passed	O
Frankland	O

that	O

The	O

anything	O

With	O

bounds	O
the	O

down	O

following	O
hard	O

by	O

Then	O
Holmes	O
and	O
I	O
both	O
fired	O
together	O

and	O
the	O
creature	O
gave	O
a	O
hideous	O
howl	O

which	O
showed	O
that	O
one	O
at	O

him	O

bounded	O

Far	O
away	O
on	O

glaring	O
helplessly	O
at	O
the	O
frightful	O

was	O
hunting	O
him	O
down	O

But	O
that	O
cry	O
of	O
pain	O
from	O
the	O
hound	O
had	O
blown	O
all	O

to	O
the	O

If	O

Never	O

he	O

In	O

we	O
flew	O
up	O
the	O
track	O
we	O
heard	O
scream	O
after	O
scream	O
from	O
Sir	O
Henry	O
and	O
the	O
deep	O
roar	O
of	O
the	O
hound	O

I	O
was	O
in	O

But	O
the	O
next	O

emptied	O
five	O

With	O

a	O
vicious	O

in	O

it	O
rolled	O
upon	O

back	O

furiously	O

then	O
fell	O
limp	O
upon	O

I	O
stooped	O

pressed	O
my	O
pistol	O
to	O
the	O
dreadful	O

shimmering	O
head	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
useless	O
to	O

The	O

was	O
dead	O

Sir	O

lay	O

where	O
he	O

We	O
tore	O
away	O
his	O

Holmes	O
breathed	O
a	O
prayer	O

there	O
was	O
no	O

it	O
of	O
that	O
desperate	O

whom	O
we	O
expected	O

we	O
were	O

by	O
an	O
object	O
so	O
strange	O

unexpected	O
that	O
we	O
stood	O
for	O
a	O

In	O

was	O
an	O

To	O
this	O

swathed	O

in	O

had	O
been	O
used	O
to	O
secure	O
it	O
that	O

One	O

was	O

the	O

to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
found	O
a	O
pathway	O
through	O
the	O

It	O
helped	O
us	O
to	O
realize	O
the	O
horror	O
of	O
this	O
woman	O
's	O
life	O
when	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
eagerness	O

joy	O
with	O
which	O
she	O
laid	O
us	O
on	O
her	O

upon	O

Once	O
